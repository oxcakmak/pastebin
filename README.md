### Installation
* Unzip all the files and upload them to the htdocs or www folder.
* Create a database and import the sql file.
* After configuring the database, open the "core/database.php" file and edit the relevant fields.
* Open the "core/config.php" file and replace the localhost section with your own domain name.
* You can create an admin account from the database by simply changing the username, or you can create a new user and assign new roles to the old user.

If you have any problems, do not hesitate to use the issues section or contact me via my website.
